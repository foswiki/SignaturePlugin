---+ Signature Plugin

This plugin supports a simple tag which appears as a button with the label given by the =SIGNATURELABEL= setting. When clicked, it is replaced by the text given in the =SIGNATUREFORMAT= setting (this is typically the name of the logged in user and the current date).

---++ Syntax Rules

Insert the tag %<nop>SIGNATURE% anywhere in the topic, as many times as you like. Each such tag will create a signature button.

The following parameters are supported for the %<nop>SIGNATURE% tag.

| *Parameter:* | *Description:* | *Default:* |
| ="name"= | The wiki name of a user or group or a list of users/groups. Only these users or members of these groups are allowed to sign here. | |
| ="format"= | The signature format for this particular signature. The syntax is the same as for the setting variable =SIGNATUREFORMAT=. | |

---++ Plugin Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>SIGNATUREPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION%==
   * Format of the signature line. The variables =$wikiusername=, =$wikiname=, $username, and =$date= can be used, indicating the WikiName of the logged in user prefixed with the user web, the WikiName of the logged in user, the login name of the logged in user, and the date of signing, respectively. 
      * Set SIGNATUREFORMAT = $wikiusername - $date
   * Label of the signature button 
      * Set SIGNATURELABEL = Sign

   * One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic: 
      * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Supports electronic signatures
